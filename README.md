A small game made in JavaScript.

Nostalgia is always a good thing, especially when it reminds us of good times. In my childhood I started to like and play many games, simple and hosted in games like "ClickJogos", among others. So, as a JavaScript course completion, I made a small game, in JavaScript, based on a code already made in a JS course.
